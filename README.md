## Remixed Breadcrumbs

A modification for Simple Machines Forum 2.1 that changes the layout of the Breadcrumbs (linktree) in Curve2 to a fancier display.

This modification is created from the "Remixed Breadcrumbs" Tips&Tricks topic: https://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=580159.0 by TwitchisMental

## Settings

There are no settings for this mod. 

The layout and colors are based on the Curve2 theme and is using the new css file: RemixedBreadcrumbs.css: the mod can also update other themes if these are curve2 variations. If needed a copy of the RemixedBreadcrumbs.css can be placed in the other theme css folder and adapted to suit the specific theme color requirements.
