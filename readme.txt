[size=large][b]Settings[/b][/size]

There are no settings for this mod. 

The layout and colors are based on the Curve2 theme and is using the new css file: RemixedBreadcrumbs.css: the mod can also update other themes if these are curve2 variations. If needed a copy of the RemixedBreadcrumbs.css can be placed in the other theme css folder and adapted to suit the specific theme color requirements.
